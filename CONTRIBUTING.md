## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

| Pattern | Use |
|---------|-----|
| `feat/<feature-name>` | New features |
| `fix/<issue-description>` | Bug fixes |
| `docs/<what-changed>` | Documentation changes |
| `chore/<task>` | Maintenance tasks |

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). `relizy` reads these to generate changelogs automatically.

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `feat:` | A new feature |
| `fix:` | A bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation only |
| `style:` | No logic change |
| `refactor:` | Neither fix nor feature |
| `perf:` | Performance improvement |
| `test:` | Adding or correcting tests |
| `chore:` | Build process or tooling |

### Code Style

```bash
pnpm lint       # check linting errors
pnpm typecheck  # verify TypeScript types
pnpm test       # run all tests
```

---

## Testing

We use:

- **Vitest** — Test runner

```bash
pnpm test         # run all tests
pnpm test:watch   # watch mode
```

  When adding new features or fixing bugs, please include tests as this helps us validate upcoming features before they are fully integrated.
